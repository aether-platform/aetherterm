# AetherTerm User Personas & Utilization Patterns

## Overview

This document defines the primary user personas for AetherTerm and their specific utilization patterns within the system architecture. The system is designed to support distinct roles in IT operations with clear separation of responsibilities.

## User Personas

### 🏗️ IT工事監督者 (IT Operations Supervisor)
- **Primary Tool**: ControlServer
- **Role**: Work supervision and control management
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Overall work coordination and management
  - Multi-site centralized monitoring
  - Progress tracking and quality assurance
  - Resource allocation and scheduling
- **Key Activities**:
  - Monitor multiple AgentServer instances
  - Review work progress dashboards
  - Approve high-risk operations
  - Generate management reports

### 🛡️ オペレーション監査員 (Operations Auditor)
- **Primary Tool**: ControlServer
- **Role**: Audit and compliance verification
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Operations audit and compliance checking
  - Risk analysis and assessment
  - Regulatory reporting
  - Security incident investigation
- **Key Activities**:
  - Review audit logs and command history
  - Generate compliance reports
  - Analyze risk patterns and trends
  - Investigate security events

### 👨‍🔧 作業オペレータ (Operations Worker)
- **Primary Tools**: AgentServer + AgentShell
- **Role**: Hands-on technical operations
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Execute actual system operations
  - Perform maintenance and configuration tasks
  - Follow established procedures and protocols
  - Report issues and completion status
- **Key Activities**:
  - **AgentServer (Web)**:
    - Receive work instructions and guidance
    - Consult AI for technical assistance
    - Access documentation and procedures
    - Communicate with supervisors
  - **AgentShell (Local)**:
    - Execute direct shell commands on target systems
    - Perform system configuration and maintenance
    - Monitor system status and performance
    - Handle emergency operations

## System Architecture Mapping

```
ControlServer (Management Layer):
├ IT工事監督者 ← Work coordination & progress management
└ オペレーション監査員 ← Audit & compliance monitoring

Operations Layer:
├ AgentServer (Web Interface) ← Guidance & AI assistance
└ AgentShell (Direct Operations) ← System execution & monitoring
    ↑
作業オペレータ (Operations Worker)
```

## Workflow Integration

### Typical Operation Flow
1. **Planning Phase**: IT工事監督者 creates work plans and assigns tasks
2. **Execution Phase**: 作業オペレータ uses AgentServer for guidance and AgentShell for execution
3. **Monitoring Phase**: IT工事監督者 tracks progress via ControlServer
4. **Audit Phase**: オペレーション監査員 reviews logs and generates compliance reports

### Communication Patterns
- **Supervisor → Operator**: Work instructions, approvals, emergency stops
- **Operator → Supervisor**: Progress reports, issue escalation, completion status
- **Auditor → System**: Log queries, compliance checks, incident investigation
- **AI → Operator**: Technical guidance, risk warnings, procedure recommendations

## Business Value by Persona

### IT工事監督者
- **Efficiency**: 40-60% reduction in coordination overhead
- **Quality**: Real-time visibility into all operations
- **Risk Management**: Proactive issue identification and intervention
- **Resource Optimization**: Better allocation of technical resources

### オペレーション監査員
- **Compliance**: Automated audit trail generation
- **Risk Assessment**: AI-powered pattern analysis
- **Reporting**: Streamlined regulatory compliance reporting
- **Investigation**: Rapid incident analysis and root cause identification

### 作業オペレータ
- **Safety**: AI-assisted risk detection and prevention
- **Efficiency**: 30-50% reduction in manual operation time
- **Learning**: Continuous skill development through AI guidance
- **Quality**: Reduced human error through intelligent assistance

## Implementation Considerations

### Role-Based Access Control
- Each persona requires specific permissions and interface customizations
- ControlServer provides different dashboards for supervisors vs auditors
- AgentServer/AgentShell integration must be seamless for operators

### Training Requirements
- **IT工事監督者**: Dashboard navigation, report interpretation, escalation procedures
- **オペレーション監査員**: Audit tools, compliance frameworks, investigation techniques
- **作業オペレータ**: Dual-interface workflow, AI interaction, safety protocols

### Success Metrics
- **Supervision Efficiency**: Number of concurrent operations managed per supervisor
- **Audit Coverage**: Percentage of operations with complete audit trails
- **Operation Safety**: Reduction in high-risk incidents and errors
- **Worker Productivity**: Commands executed per hour with AI assistance
